# Leynos
Lightweight PHP7 MVC framework featuring chainable controllers. PHP â‰¥ 7.1.0 is required.

The Leynos framework project aims to provide an open source MVC framework written entirely in PHP7. This framework is
designed to be as flexible as it is compact. Most PHP applications built with the MVC pattern running atop a framework
or master controller inherently require that the code in the framework always executes on every request. Therefore the
objective should be to provide the essentials to facilitate a functional MVC design in the application, and nothing
more.

Leynos is designed to be flexible and reprogrammable via configuration. With proper interfacing, libraries can plug
right into Leynos to power it which in turn powers your application. Connect template engines such as Twig or Smarty,
and memory stores such as Redis or memcached, as well as any database that can be accessed through PHP's PDO abstraction
layer.

This was originally a custom implementation for a specific application, then proceeded to evolve into a standalone
framework which is its starting point here, beginning with ripping out any hard associations to the application it was
originally designed to power. There are design changes and additions coming before it can be realistically adopted. This
README shall be updated as development advances, to elaborate upon Leynos' functionality and to document its usage, as
well as provide friendly instructions on hacking Leynos, for building new extensions for it which may not be integrated
to the mainline, and even for hacking the kernel of the framework itself to truly customise its behaviour to tailor it
for a specific application altogether.
